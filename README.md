# Marking timer

A simple web widget ([try here](https://michalkonecny.github.io/marking-timer/)) for recording how long a repeated task (such as exam marking) takes.  The history of times is recorded in the window local store and displayed together with the overall average duration and the average for the last few instances.  I developed the widget to help me keep motivation and focus while ploughing through over 100 exam scripts.
